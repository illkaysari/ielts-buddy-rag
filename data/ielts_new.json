From this video, I learned some useful knife skills, such as how to hold a knife properly and different cutting techniques. It also taught me the importance of timing and seasoning in cooking, which has made a big difference in the dishes I make now. Overall, it was an eye-opening experience, and it boosted my confidence in the kitchen."

        "instruction": "Describe a challenge you faced that you thought was rather difficult.",
        "response": "One of the most challenging situations I faced was when I had to deliver a presentation in English at an international conference last year in Shanghai. Although I’ve been studying English for years, speaking in front of a large audience, especially one filled with native speakers, was incredibly daunting. I had prepared my speech thoroughly, but as the day approached, I began to doubt my language skills and my ability to engage the audience. It felt like an uphill battle because I was worried about making mistakes or not being understood. At the time, I was filled with anxiety and self-doubt. However, I knew this was a great opportunity for personal growth. Despite the fear, I pushed myself to go through with it, and afterward, I felt a great sense of accomplishment. It taught me the value of stepping out of my comfort zone and facing my fears head-on."

        "response": "A prize that stands out in my memory is a medal I received for completing a marathon a couple of years ago. I got it in the fall of 2021 when I participated in my first-ever marathon in Beijing. To earn this medal, I had to push myself both physically and mentally for months. I remember waking up early every morning to train, slowly increasing my distance each week, and building my stamina. Crossing the finish line was a moment of pure joy and relief, but also disbelief—I couldn’t believe I had actually done it! Receiving the medal was such a rewarding experience. It wasn’t just a piece of metal; it symbolized all the hard work, determination, and perseverance I had put into reaching my goal. It gave me a deep sense of pride and accomplishment."

        "response": "A few weeks ago, I watched a movie called Oppenheimer. It's a historical drama about the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist behind the creation of the atomic bomb. I saw it at a cinema with a friend, and we both really enjoyed it. The film was intense and thought-provoking, especially how it showed the ethical dilemmas faced by scientists during that time. I wanted to discuss it because it wasn’t just entertaining, but it also made me think deeply about the impact of science on society. I’d definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys history and complex characters."

I picked up the call, and it turned out to be a woman who had dialed the wrong number. She asked if she was speaking to 'John,' but I told her she had the wrong person. She apologized and explained that she was trying to reach a friend about an urgent matter. I responded politely, letting her know it was no problem, and she quickly hung up. The whole experience was a bit awkward because I was in a quiet public place, and I felt like people around me might be listening. However, it also made me realize the importance of being patient and understanding when such situations occur."

        "response": "I remember losing my wallet last winter while I was traveling in Guangzhou. The wallet wasn’t just valuable because of the cash inside; it also held my ID, bank cards, and a few sentimental items like a photo of my family. It was worth around 500 yuan, but its sentimental value was priceless. I think I lost it when I was rushing to catch a train. I had placed it in the outer pocket of my bag, and somehow, in the chaos of getting through security, it must have slipped out. When I realized it was gone, I felt a wave of panic and frustration. I retraced my steps and asked the station staff, but it was nowhere to be found. It was a stressful experience, but it also taught me to be more careful and aware of my belongings, especially when traveling."

I turned to my mentor, Mr. Chen, who has always been a great source of wisdom and guidance. I sought his advice because I was feeling uncertain and anxious about leaving my stable job for a new opportunity that seemed risky but exciting. I explained my situation to him, and he listened carefully before giving his advice. He suggested that I weigh the pros and cons of both options and think about what would make me happiest in the long run. He also reminded me that taking calculated risks can lead to personal growth. I felt his advice was thoughtful and practical, and it helped me feel more confident in making my decision. I ultimately decided to take the new job, and I’ve been happier ever since."
